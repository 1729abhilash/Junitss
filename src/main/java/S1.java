        //what is junit
        //simple is a simple,open source framwork
        //to write and run repeateable tasks;
        //junit is a java testing framework used to test a piee
        //of java code (Code under test or System under test)
        //it has a runner which determines the tests, executes those test,
        //reports the results.
        //junit test validates expected result with acutal output
        //from the code under test.
        //thus,based on assertions success or failure it provide
        //feedback to developer


        //problems  with junit 4
        //junit.jar was single fat jar
         //no flexible api
        //no java 8 features
        //no extension point



        //soulutio with junit5

        //multiple small jars
        // flexible api
        //java 8 feautes
        //extendsion points


        //sepearation of concers(junit 5)
        //an api for developer to write test
        //mecahnism to discover and execute test
        //an api for externsal to run tests in their environment


        //junit 5 components

        //junit is majorioy divided into 3 main components
